# ManDrake

ManDrake is a native, open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man page</a> editor for OS X. It has syntax highlighting and a live-updating rendered preview of the man page.

Long story short, I was sick of writing man pages in an endless cycle of edit-view, edit-view so I decided to do something about it and made this editor. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it works really well for me.

You can download a pre-built binary of version 2.2 here:
