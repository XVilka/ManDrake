# ManDrake

ManDrake is a native, open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man page</a> editor for OS X. It has `groff` syntax highlighting, `mandoc` syntax validation and shows a live-updating rendered preview of the man page during editing.

Long story short, I was sick of writing man pages in an endless cycle of edit-view, edit-view so I decided to do something about it and made this editor. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it works really well for me.

You can download a pre-built binary of version 3.0 here:
