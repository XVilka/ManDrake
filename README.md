# ManDrake

ManDrake is a native, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man page</a> editor for OS X. It has syntax highlighting, live <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandoc">`mandoc`</a> syntax validation and a live-updating rendered preview of the man page during editing.

Long story short, I was sick of writing man pages in an endless cycle of edit-view, edit-view so I decided to do something about it and made this editor. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it works really well for me.

* a recent version of Xcode with support for ARC and subscripting
* OS X SDK (10.7 or later)
* Git
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

You may also need to install Xcodeâ€™s command line tools with the following command, if you want to re-build the included `cat2html` and `mandoc` binaries 

    xcode-select --install

### Environment Setup

After cloning the repository, run the following commands inside the repository root (i.e. the directory containing this `README.md` file):

    pod install

This installs all the dependencies required.

## Captain Mandrake

> **Do I look all rancid and clotted? You look at me, Jack. Eh? Look, eh? And I drink a lot of water, you know. I'm what you might call a water man, Jack - that's what I am. And I can swear to you, my boy, swear to you, that there's nothing wrong with my bodily fluids. Not a thing, Jackie.**

Here's **Group Captain Lionel Mandrake** from Kubrick's wonderful [*Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/) along with Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, memorably rendered by Sterling Hayden:
